This Program uses a .h and .c file to show ABT in the C language. It implements
a QUEUE to store integers given by the output line by line.
P from the input means print the queue as is, if empty it prints an empty line.
E means enqueue an integer to the queue.
D means dequeue an integer from the queue.(FIFO) if there is nothing to dequeue, then
It prints “empty”.


Running “make check” won’t work in the Mac OS terminal but it works on the unix
When running valgrind on Unix, there were 0 leaks reported.
