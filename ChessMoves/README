This program takes a line of input at a time, storing chess pieces on a board until 
it encounters a simicolon at which point it begins a series of moves decided by the input.
If all the moves are legal the output for that ChessBoard is “legal”
If any of the moves are illegal the output is “illegal” followed by 4 integers describing the move that was illegal.
This code is all my own and none was copied from any other sources.
A lot of this code is built off HW2 (ChessBoard.java)
